## Addressing Concerns

After my last post, I received a very real, nonzero number of DMs bearing *implications*.

That's right.

Messages like, "Nice blog post. I'm sure you totally know how to use RenderDoc." and "Nice RenderDoc tutorial." as well as "You don't know how to use RenderDoc, do you?"

I even got a message from Baldur "Dr. Render" Karlsson asking to see my RenderDoc operator's license. Which I definitely have. And it's not expired.

I just, uh, don't have it on me right now, officer.
