## New Hotness

Quick update today, but I've got some *very* exciting news coming soon.

The biggest news of the day is that work is underway to merge some patches from Duncan Hopkins which [enable zink to run on Mac OS](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/7383) using [MoltenVK](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK). This has significant potential to improve OpenGL support on that platform, so it's awesome that work has been done to get the ball rolling there.

In only slightly less monumental news though, Adam Jackson is already underway with [Vulkan WSI work](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/3608) for zink, which is going to be huge for performance.
