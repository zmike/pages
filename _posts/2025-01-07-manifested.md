# I'm not saying we're doing it

Don't quote me. We're not doing it.

Unless we are, in which case [everything I wrote last year]({{site.url}}/manifesto) may come to pass with the advent of the unified OpenGL/ES '25 release. This is not a release announcement, but I'm tentatively planning to provide the date of the announcement once the ray-tracing EXT goes live.

Confused? Well, you better figure it out quick cuz this is only the first week of 2025 and we got 51 more to go.

In the meanwhile, get in the car: we're going [mesh shading](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenGL-Registry/pull/640).

# DISCLAIMER
I gotta do this every year because we can't have fun anymore on the internet. C'mon. Obviously there's no ray-tracing EXT in the pipe BECAUSE WE'RE GOING MESH SHAAADIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
