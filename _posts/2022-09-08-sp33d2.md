## Need Another Hit

You ever stop in the middle of writing some code when it hits you? That nagging feeling. It's in the back of your mind, relentlessly gnawing away. Making you question your decisions. Making you wonder what you're doing with your life. You're plugging away happily, when suddenly you remember **I haven't optimized any code in *hours***.

It's no way to work.

It's no way to live.

Let's get back to our roots, blog.

## New Edition
For this edition of the blog, we're hopping off the usual tracks and onto a different set entirely: Vulkan driver optimization. I can already hear what you're thinking.

Vulkan drivers are already fast. Go back to doing something useful, like making GL work.

First: no they're not.

Second: I'm doing the opposite of that.

Third: shut up, it's my blog.

How does one optimize Vulkan drivers? As we all know, any great optimization needs a test case. And in the case of Vulkan, everyone who's anyone (me) uses Zink as their test case. The reasons for this are many and varied because I say they are, but the important one to keep in mind is, as always `drawoverhead`.

For those who can't remember the [times]({{site.url}}/hold-em) I have [previously]({{site.url}}/overhead) blogged [about]({{site.url}}/layin-that-pipe) the world's [premiere]({{site.url}}/description) benchmarking tool, don't worry. As with any great form of entertainment, I've prepared a recap.

## TL;DR drawoverhead
Suppose you are a large gaming-oriented company that sells hardware. Your hardware runs on a battery. The battery has a finite charge. Every bit of power drained from the battery powers the device so that users can play games.

Wouldn't it be great if that battery lasted longer?

There are a number of ways to achieve this goal. Because this is my blog, I'm going to talk about the one that doesn't involve underclocking or reducing graphical settings.

Obviously I'm talking about optimization, the process by which a smart and talented reader of StackOverflow copies and pastes code in exactly the right sequence such that, upon resolving all compilation errors, execution of a program utilizes fewer resources.

Now because everyone reading this is a GPU driver developer, we all know that optimization comes in two forms, optimizing for CPU and optimizing for GPU. But GPU optimization is easy. Anyone can do that. You just strap on your [RadeonGPUProfiler](https://gpuopen.com/rgp/) or [Nsight](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-graphics) or <insert Intel tool name here>, glance at the output, mumble mumble mumble, and blammo, your GPU is running like a clock. A really fast one though. With like a trillion hands all spinning at once.
  
So we're done with GPU optimization, but we're still not fast enough. The battery still doesn't last forever, and the users are still complaining on Reddit that they can't even finish a casual playthrough of Elden Ring without needing to plug in.
  
This brings us to "CPU optimization", the process by which we use more esoteric tools like [perf](http://www.brendangregg.com/perf.html) or [dtrace](http://dtrace.org/blogs/about/) or
