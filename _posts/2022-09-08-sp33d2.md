## Need Another Hit

You ever stop in the middle of writing some code when it hits you? That nagging feeling. It's in the back of your mind, relentlessly gnawing away. Making you question your decisions. Making you wonder what you're doing with your life. You're plugging away happily, when suddenly you remember **I haven't optimized any code in *hours***.

It's no way to work.

It's no way to live.

Let's get back to our roots, blog.

## New Edition
For this edition of the blog, we're hopping off the usual tracks and onto a different set entirely: Vulkan driver optimization. I can already hear what you're thinking.

Vulkan drivers are already fast. Go back to doing something useful, like making GL work.

First: no they're not.

Second: I'm doing the opposite of that.

Third: shut up, it's my blog.

How does one optimize Vulkan drivers? As we all know, any great optimization needs a test case. And in the case of Vulkan, everyone who's anyone (me) uses Zink as their test case.
