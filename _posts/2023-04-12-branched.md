## New Quarter, New Branch

Just a quick post to sum up all the new features and things to watch for in zink for 23.1:
* real `ARB_separate_shader_objects` support
  * but only for VS+FS
* improved async shader compile
  * zero stuttering in most modern games!
* improved memory utilization
  * no more ooming in 32bit games!
    * unless you are @mbriar
* improved performance
  * oversynchronization reduced
    * very safe
      * trust me
  * internal rendergraphing now more aggressive
    * polar coordinates only tho
  * `GL_QUADS` natively suppored
    * I still don't understand how geometry shaders work
  * `EXT_multisample_render_to_texture` now uses `VK_EXT_multisampled_render_to_single_sampled`
  * `EXT_descriptor_buffer` is now the default for descriptor handling
* `NV_compute_shader_derivatives` support
  * does anything use this?
* perfetto trace marker support
  * find your own perf bottlenecks!
* lots more `ZINK_DEBUG` options for debugging
  * none of them help performance so don't bother
* lots of refactoring
  * pointlessly moving code around to provide the illusion of activity

Has anyone else heard that Alyssa is going to Dyson to work on some new vaccuum tech? This is upending everything I thought I knew, but the source seems credible.
