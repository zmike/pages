## TFW Long Game Loads

I'm typing this up between loads and runs of various games I'm testing, since bug reports for games are somehow already a thing, and there's a lot of them.

The worst part about testing games is the unbelievably long load times (and startup videos) most of them have, not to mention those long, panning camera shots at the start of the game before gameplay begins and I can start crashing.

But this isn't a post about games.

No, no, there's plenty of time for such things.

This is a combo post: part roundup because blogging has been sporadic the past couple weeks, and part feature.
