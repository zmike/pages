## Brain Hurty

It's been a very long week for me, and I'm only just winding down now after dissecting and resolving a crazy fp64/ssbo bug. I'm too scrambled to jump into any code, so let's just do another fluff day and review happenings in mainline mesa which relate to zink.

## MRs Landed
Thanks to the tireless, eagle-eyed reviewing of Erik Faye-Lund, a ton of zink patches out of `zink-wip` have landed this week. Here's an overview of that in backwards historical order:
* [ARB_sample_shading](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/7192), a core feature for GL 4.0
* [ARB_draw_indirect](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/7191), another core feature for GL 4.0
* [version updates](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/7190) which mean zink now fully supports GL 3.3
* [geometry shaders](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/7139), a core feature of GL 3.3
* [stencil wrap fixes](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/7176) which fix at least one unit test (thanks to Eric Anholt for an impressively speedy review on this one)
* [missing ARB_vertex_type_2_10_10_10_rev format types](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/7140) which complete the requirements for the core GL 3.3 feature
* [ARB_texture_buffer_object](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/7132), a core GL 3.1 feature
* [ntv variable refactoring](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/7130) to reduce code duplication in the future
* [documentation](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/7116) from Erik himself which improves and updates the page [here](https://docs.mesa3d.org/gallium/drivers/zink.html)
* [ntv slot remapping improvements](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/7100) to reduce the overhead of GL builtin variable compatibility and maximize the number of variable slots available to users
* [pipe caps for maximum varying counts](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/7110)
* [resource synchronization](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/6924) which will finally ensure that we can wait on operations to finish when appropriate and/or just determine resource usage when necessary
* [stop erroneously reporting ssbos as supported](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/7113) from Erik to hopefully stop us from running so many ssbo-related tests until support has actually landed
* [setup handling for all Vulkan extensions](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/7099) so that now there's no more MRs necessary to start landing patches for these features

## Versions Bumped
Zink has grown tremendously over the past day or so of MRs landing, going from GLSL 1.30 and GL 3.0 to **GLSL and GL 3.30**.

It can even run Blender now. Unless you're [running it under Wayland](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/3654).
