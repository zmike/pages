## New Month, New Post

I'm going to kick off this post and month by saying that in my defense, I was going to write this post weeks ago, but then I didn't, and then I got sidetracked, but I had the screenshots open the whole time so it's not like I forgot, but then I did forget for a little while, and then my session died because the man the myth the legend the as-seen-on-the-web-with-a-different-meaning Adam "ajax" Jackson pranked me with a GLX patch, but I started a new session, and gimp recovered my screenshots, and I remembered I needed to post, and I got distracted even more, and now it's like three whole weeks later and here we are at the post I was going to write last month but didn't get around to but now it's totally been gotten to.

You're welcome.

## Release

There's a new Mesa release in the pipeline, and its name is 22.2. Cool stuff happening in that release: Zink passes GL 4.6 conformance tests on Lavapipe and ANV, would almost pass on RADV if [Mesa could even compile shaders for sparse texture tests](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/16547), and is reasonably close to passing on NVIDIA's beta driver except for the cases which don't pass because of unfixed NVIDIA driver bugs. Also Kopper is way better. And some other stuff that I could totally handwave but I'm too tired.

Recap over, now let's get down to some technical mumbo-jumbo.

## Render Passes
They exist in Vulkan, and I hate them, but I'm not talking specifically about [VkRenderPass](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VkRenderPass.html). Instead, I'm referring to the abstract concept of "render passes" which includes the better-in-every-way dynamic rendering variant.

Render passes control how rendering works. There's load operations which determine how data is retrieved from the framebuffer (I also hate framebuffers) attachments, there's store operations which determine how data is stored back to the attachments (I hate this part too), and then there's "dependencies" (better believe I hate these) which manage synchronization between operations, and input attachments (everyone hates these) which enable reading attachment data in shaders, and then also render pass instances have to be started and stopped any time any attachments or framebuffer geometry changes (this sucks), and to top it all off, transfer operations can't be executed while render passes are active (mega sucks).

Also there's *nested* render passes, but I'm literally fearing for my life even mentioning them where other driver developers can see, so let's move on.

## On Topic
Today's suck is focused on render passes and transfer operations: why can't they just get along?

Here's a sample command stream from a [bug I recently solved](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/6845):

[![reorder-before.png]({{site.url}}/assets/renderdoc/reorder-before.png)]({{site.url}}/assets/renderdoc/reorder-before.png)

Notice how the command stream continually starts and stops the renderpass to execute transfer operations. If you're on a desktop, you're like whatever just give me frames, but if you're on a mobile device with a tiling GPU, this is probably sending you sprinting for your Tik-Tok so you don't have to look at the scary perf demons anymore.

Until recently, I would've been in the former camp, but guess what: as of Mesa 22.2, Zink on Turnip is Officially Supported.
