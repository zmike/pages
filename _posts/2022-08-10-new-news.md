## New Month, New Post

I'm going to kick off this post and month by saying that in my defense, I was going to write this post weeks ago, but then I didn't, and then I got sidetracked, but I had the screenshots open the whole time so it's not like I forgot, but then I did forget for a little while, and then my session died because the man the myth the legend the as-seen-on-the-web-with-a-different-meaning Adam "ajax" Jackson pranked me with a GLX patch, but I started a new session, and gimp recovered my screenshots, and I remembered I needed to post, and I got distracted even more, and now it's like three whole weeks later and here we are at the post I was going to write last month but didn't get around to but now it's totally been gotten to and you're welcome.
