## A Brief Review

As time/sanity permit, I'll be trying to do roundup posts for zink happenings each week. Here's a look back at things that happened, in no particular order:
* [Windows compile fixes](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/7432) landed
* [Shader variant infrastructure](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/7193) landed
* Got a ticket about [Quake3 issues](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/3776), which, after a flurry of activity, culminated in
  * [an optimization for mipmap generation](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/7604)
  * discovery of [a RADV bug](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/3790)
* [more steps towards more correct Vulkan versioning](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/7447)
