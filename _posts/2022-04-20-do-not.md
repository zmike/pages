## Let Your Memes Be Dreams

With Mesa 22.1 RC1 firmly out the door, most eyes have turned towards Mesa 22.2.

But not all eyes.

No, while most expected me to be rocketing off towards the next shiny feature, one ticket caught my eye:

[Mesa 22.1rc1: Zink on Windows doesn't work even simple wglgears app fails..](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/6337)

Sadly, I don't support Windows. I don't have a test machine to run it, and I don't even have a VM I could spin up to run Lavapipe. I knew that Kopper was going to cause problems with other frontends, but I didn't know how many other frontends were actually being used.

The answer was not zero, unfortunately. Plenty of users were enjoying the slow, software driver speed of Zink on Windows to spin those gears, and I had just crushed their dreams.

As I had no plans to change anything here, it would take a new hero to set things right.

## The Hero We Deserve

Who here loves [X-Plane](https://www.x-plane.com/)?

I love X-Plane. It's my favorite flight simulator. If I could, I'd play it all day every day. And do you know who my favorite X-Plane developer is?

Friend of the blog and part-time Zink developer, Sidney Just.

Some of you might know him from his [extensive collection of artisanal blog posts](https://developer.x-plane.com/author/justsid/). Some might have seen his work [enabling Vulkan<->OpenGL interop in Mesa on Windows](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/15504).

But did you know that Sidney's latest project is much more groundbreaking than just bumping Zink's supported extension count far beyond the reach of every other driver?

What if I told you that this image

is Zink running wglgears on NVIDIA on Windows at full speed?
