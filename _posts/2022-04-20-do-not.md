## Let Your Memes Be Dreams

With Mesa 22.1 RC1 firmly out the door, most eyes have turned towards Mesa 22.2.

But not all eyes.

No, while most expected me to be rocketing off towards the next shiny feature, one ticket caught my eye:

[Mesa 22.1rc1: Zink on Windows doesn't work even simple wglgears app fails..](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/6337)

Sadly, I don't support Windows. I don't have a test machine to run it, and I don't even have a VM I could spin up to run Lavapipe. I knew that Kopper was going to cause problems with other frontends, but I didn't know how many other frontends were actually being used.

The answer was not zero, unfortunately. Plenty of users were enjoying the slow, software driver speed of Zink on Windows to spin those gears, and I had just crushed their dreams.

As I had no plans to change anything here, it would take a new hero to set things right.

## The Hero We Deserve
