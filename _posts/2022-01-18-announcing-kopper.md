## Suspicion

The last thing I remember Thursday was trying to get the truth out about Jason Ekstrand's new role. Days have now passed, and I can't remember what I was about to say or what I did over the extended weekend.

But Big Triangle sure has been busy. It's clear I was on to something, because otherwise they wouldn't have taken such drastic measures. Look at this: [jekstrand is claiming Collabora has hired him](https://www.jlekstrand.net/jason/blog/2022/01/hello-collabora/). This is clearly part of a larger coverup, and the graphics news media are [eating](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Ekstrand-New-Job) it [up](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/collabora-pulls-in-jason-ekstrand-to-work-on-linux-graphics-drivers/).

Congratulations to him, sure, but it's obvious this is just another attempt to throw us off the trail. We may never find out what Jason's *real* new job is, but that doesn't mean we're going to stop following the hints clues as they accumulate. Sooner or later, Big Triangle is going to slip up, and then we'll all know the truth.

## Progress
In the meantime, zink goes on. I've spent quite a long while tinkering with NVIDIA and getting a solid baseline of CTS results. At present, I'm down to about 800 combined fails for GL 4.6 and ES 3.2. Given that lavapipe is at around 80 and RADV is just over 600, both excluding the confidential test suites, this is a pretty decent start.

This is probably going to be the last time I'm on nvidia for a while, and it hasn't been too bad overall.

## The Year's First Rebrand
The (second) biggest news story for today is a rebrand.

**Copper** is being renamed.

It will, in fact, be named **Kopper** to match the zink/vulkan naming scheme.

I can't overstate how significant this change is and how massive the ecosystem changes around it will be.

Just huge. Like the number of words in this blog post.
