## Well

I've been meaning to blog for a while.

As per usual.

Finally though, I'm doing it. It's been a month. Roundup time.

## 22.1
Mesa 22.1 is out, and it has the best zink release of all time. You've got features like:
* kopper
* kopper
* kopper

Really not sure I'm getting across how momentous kopper is, but it's probably the biggest thing to happen to zink since... I don't know. Threaded context?

B I G.

## Bugs
There's a lot of bugs in the world. As of now, there's a lot fewer bugs in zink than there used to be.

How many fewer, you might ask?

Let's take a gander.

* 0 GL4.6 CTS fails for [lavapipe](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/blob/main/src/gallium/drivers/zink/ci/zink-lvp-fails.txt)
* 0 GL4.6 CTS fails for the new [ANV CI job](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/16497) I just added
* less than 5 GL4.6 CTS fails for [RADV](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/blob/main/src/gallium/drivers/zink/ci/zink-radv-fails.txt)
* this space reserved for [NVIDIA](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/blob/main/src/gallium/drivers/zink/ci/zink-nv-fails.txt), which has bugs in CTS itself and(probably) driver issues, but is still a very low count

In short, conformance submission pending.

## Anniversary
This roughly marks 2 years since I started working on zink full-time.

Hooray.

## Windows
A quick follow-up to the previous post: there was an issue in the initial WGL handling which prevented zink from loading as expected. This is now [fixed](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/16569).
