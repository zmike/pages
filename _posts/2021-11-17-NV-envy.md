## Bringing The Latest Zink Updates

In an earlier post I talked about [Copper]({{site.url}}/pipe-magic) and what it could do on the way to a [zink future]({{site.url}}/the-future-is-nowish/).

What I didn't talk about was WSI, or the fact that I've already fully implemented it in the course of bashing Copper into a functional state.

## Window System Integration
...was the final step for zink becoming truly usable.

At present, zink has a very hacky architecture where it loads through the regular driver path, but then for every image that is presented on the screen, it keeps a shadow copy which it blits to just before scanout.

Usually this works great, other than the obvious (but minor) overhead that the blit incurs.

Where it doesn't work great, however, is on non-Mesa drivers.

That's right. I'm looking at you, NVIDIA.

As long-time blog enthusiasts will remember, I had NVIDIA running on zink [some time ago]({{site.url}}/nv), but there was a problem as it related to performance. Specifically, that single blit turned into a blit and then a full-frame CPU copy, which made getting any sort of game running with usable FPS a bit of a challenge.

WSI solves this by letting the Vulkan driver handle the scanout image entirely, removing all the copies to let zink render more like a normal driver (or game/app).
