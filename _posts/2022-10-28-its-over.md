## Yes

I know what you're thinking, and I had to do it.

I had literally no other option, in that I asked myself whether there was any other option and decided the answer was no.

There comes a time in every Mesa developer's life when they start searching for answers. Real question answers, not just "why are there so many pipe caps?" or "is it possible to understand the GLSL compiler?"

That time for me was very recent.

Do we really need *two* CL frontends in Mesa?

My heart says yes. Not only do we need two, we probably need three, such as the Erlang-based one that Jason "99.4% CTS pass-rate" Ekstrand was briefly working on last year to throw off avid bloggers who were getting too close to his real next job. Or the one that Adam "Why Am I In Your Blog?" Jackson has been quietly injecting into the Xserver codebase for the past decade.

Despite these entirely valid and extant other CL implementations, my brain tells me that we probably don't even need a single CL implementation in Mesa, let alone one that's pending CL 3.0 conformance certification, is written in the most prominent of all the languages spoken by crabs, and has by far the most sane and credible  Mesa developer working full-time on it.

So yeah.
