## I Hate Construction.

Specifically when it's right outside my house and starts at 5:30AM with heavy machinery moving around.

With this said, I'm overdue for a post, and if I don't set a good example by continuing to blog, why would anyone else?

* ~~some obscure vbuf thing~~
* ~~shower~~
* make zink usable for gaming
* improve shader caching

Looks like the next thing on the list is shader caching.
