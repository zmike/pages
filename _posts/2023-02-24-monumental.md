## \[AIRPLANE NOISES]

It finally happened.

Zink has been commercialized.

What does this mean, you ask? Well, look no further than this juicy [X-Plane announcement](https://developer.x-plane.com/2023/02/addressing-plugin-flickering/).

That's right, after months and decades of waiting, the testing and debugging is over, and Zink is now a gaming driver that runs real games in production for real, existing people. Who play games. At full speed.

I don't have anything further to say on the topic since the above blog post says more than enough, but if you like this, show your support and play [the best flight sim on the market that uses zink](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2014780/XPlane_12/).

Nice work, X-Plane.
