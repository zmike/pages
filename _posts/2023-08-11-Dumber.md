# It's Not Maintenance5

I just got back from lunch and have to work off some cals, and that means it's time for another big lift on the blog. Today's topic: how dumb can a driver's compiler stack be?

As I outlined in the previous post, zink's compiler stack is about to get a whole lot dumber for various reasons. But what exactly does that look like?

Lesser bloggers would simply [link to the MR](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/24634) and say "figure it out".

Here at SGC, however, I put in the extra effort so my readers can see all the awfulness that goes into each individual graphical sausage that this triangle factory is pumping out.
