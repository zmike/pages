## At Last

Those of you in-the-know are well aware that Zink has always had a crippling addiction to [seamless cubemaps](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Cubemap_Texture#Seamless_cubemap). Specifically, Vulkan doesn't support non-seamless cubemaps since nobody wants those anymore, but this is the default mode of sampling for OpenGL.

Thus, it is impossible for Zink to pass GL 4.6 conformance until this issue is resolved.

But what does this even mean?

## Cubes: They Have Faces Just Like You And Me
As veterans of intro to geometry courses all know*, a cube is a 3D shape that has six identically-sized sides called "faces". In computer graphics, each of these faces has its own content that can be read and written discretely.

When interpolating data from a cube-type texture, there are two methods:
* Using a *seamless* interpretation of a cube yields cases where pixels may be interpolated across the boundaries of faces
* Using a *non-seamless* interpretation of a cube yields cases where pixels may be clamped/wrapped at the boundary of a face

This effectively results in Zink interpolating across the boundaries of cube faces when it should instead be clamping/wrapping pixel data to a single face.

But who cares about all that *math* nonsense when the result is that Zink is still failing CTS cases?
