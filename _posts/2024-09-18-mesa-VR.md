# The New Reality

I've been traveling a bit lately, but Mesa has reached an important landmark that I wanted to broadcast to the three users out there who have been waiting years for us to reach this milestone:

Mesa now**\*** supports all the [GL OVR extensions](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenGL-Registry/tree/main/extensions/OVR).

You read that correctly.

Nearly a decade after the extensions were drafted and half that since everyone in VR-land moved to Vulkan, Mesa will now support all three of the people who still write VR applications in GL.

Big thanks to Marek for doing the [GLSL heavy lifting](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/31128) and whoever eventually rubber stamps the [followup](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/31235) which adds the last extension which is definitely being used.

**\*** Only zink users are cool enough to withstand the awesome power of these extensions.
