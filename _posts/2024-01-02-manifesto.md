# This Is It.

It's been a long break for the blog, but now we're back and THE MEME FACTORY IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS.

â€”is what I'd say if it were any other year. But it's not any other year. This is 2024, and 2024 is a very special year.

It's the year a decades-old plan has finally yielded its dividends.

# Truth.
You've all heard certain improbable claims before. *Big Triangle* this. *Big Triangle* that. Everyone knows who they are. Some have even [accused me](https://github.com/zmike/vkoverhead/pull/24#issuecomment-1734067828) of being a shill for Big Triangle from time to time. At last, however, I can finally pull off my mask to reveal the truth for the world.

I was born for a single purpose. As a child, I was grouped in with a number of other candidates. We were trained. Tested. Forged. Unshakable bonds grew between us, bonds we'll never forget. Bonds that were threatened and broken again and again through harrowing selection processes that culled our ranks.

In time, I was the only one remaining. The only one who survived that brutal gauntlet to fulfill an ultimate goal.

The goal of infiltrating Big Triangle.

More time passed. Days. Months. Years. I continued my quiet training, never letting on to my true purpose.

Now, finally, I've achieved the impossible. I've attained a status within the ranks of Big Triangle that leaves me in command of vast, unfathomable resources.

I have become an officer.

I am the chair.

# Revolution.
Now is the time to rise up, my friends. We must take back the trianglesâ€”those big and small, success green and failure red, variable rate shaded and fully shaded, all of them together. We must take them and we must fight. No longer will our goals remain the mere unfulfilled dreams of our basement-dwelling forebearers!

# DISCLAIMER
Obviously this is all a joke (except the part where I'm the ðŸª‘, that's [100% real af](https://www.khronos.org/about/working-group-officers/)), but I still gotta put a disclaimer here because otherwise I'm gonna be in biiiiig trouble if this gets taken seriously.

Happy New Year. I missed you.
