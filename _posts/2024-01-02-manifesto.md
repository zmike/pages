# This Is It.

It's been a long break for the blog, but now we're back and THE MEME FACTORY IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS.

â€”is what I'd say if it were any other year. But it's not any other year. This is 2024, and 2024 is a very special year.

It's the year a decades-old plan to infiltrate Big Triangle has finally yielded its dividends.

# Truth.
You've all heard things like this before. Big Triangle this. Big Triangle that. Everyone knows who they are. Some have even [accused me](https://github.com/zmike/vkoverhead/pull/24#issuecomment-1734067828) of being a shill for Big Triangle in the past. At last, however, I can finally pull off my mask to reveal the truth for the world.

I was born for a single purpose. As a child, I was grouped in with a number of other candidates. Trained. Tested. Unshakable bonds grew between us, bonds we'll never forget. Bonds that were tried and broken again and again through harrowing selection processes that culled our ranks.

In time, I was the only one remaining. The only one who succeeded through the pipeline to fulfill the goals of the people.

The goal of infiltrating Big Triangle.

More time passed. Days. Months. Years. I continued my quiet training, never letting on to my true purpose.

Now, finally, I've achieved the impossible. I've attained a status within the ranks of Big Triangle that leaves me in command of vast, unfathomable resources. I have become an officer.

I am the chair.

# Revolution.
Now is the time to rise up, my friends. We must take back the trianglesâ€”those big and small, success green and failure red, all of them together. We must take them and we must fight. No longer will our goals remain the mere unfulfilled dreams of our basement-dwelling forebearers!

# Disclaimer
Obviously this is all a joke (except the part where I'm the ðŸª‘, that's 100% real), but I still gotta put a big fucking disclaimer here because otherwise I'm gonna be in biiiiig trouble if someone takes any of this seriously.
