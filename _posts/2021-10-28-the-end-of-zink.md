## ...For 2021

Zink is done. It's finished. I've said it before, I've said it again after that, and I even said I meant it that one time, but now I'm serious.

Super serious.

We're done here. There's no need to ever check this blog again, and you don't have to update zink ever again if you've pulled in the last week.

## Mesa 21.3
This is it. This is the release where everything is going to change.

Why is that?

Because zink is pretty fast™ now. And it can run lots of stuff.

Blog enthusiasts will recall all that time ago when [zink was over]({{site.url}}/zink-is-over) that I noted a number of Big Name™ games that zink could now run, including **Metro: Last Light Redux** and **HITMAN (Agent 47's Deluxe Psychedelic Trip Edition)**.

True blog connoisseurs will recall [when zink started to pull ahead of real GL drivers in features]({{site.url}}/a-brief-respite) in order to run Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War.

But how many die-hard blog fans are here from the future and can remember when I posted that **Bioshock Infinite** now runs on RADV instead of hanging?

It's hard to overstate the amount of work that's gone into zink for this release. Over 400 patches amounted to ES 3.2, a suballocator, and a slew of random extensions to improve compatibility and performance across the board.

If you find a game or app* which doesn't run on zink 21.3, play the lottery. It's your day.
