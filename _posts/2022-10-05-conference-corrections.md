## It Must Be Said

...that I misspoke in the course of my XDC presentation. I want to apologize first to the live audience, for hearing such grave information firsthand, then to my fans, for disappointing them, and lastly to the ANGLE team:

During a Q&A, I stated that ANGLE uses Vulkan secondary command buffers. This is false. ANGLE does not use secondary command buffers.

There will be no further corrections.
