## First

As I mentioned a week or three ago, I deleted comments on the blog because (apparently) the widget was injecting ads. My b. I wish I could say the ad revenue was worth it, but it wasn't.

With that said, I'm looking at ways to bring comments back. I've seen a number of possibilities, but none have really grabbed me:
* [hyvor](https://hyvor.com/) looks nice, but the pricing/features seem entirely dynamic with no future guarantee what I'd actually be getting
* [disqus](https://disqus.com/) is what I was using, so I won't be going back to that
* [fastcomments](https://fastcomments.com/) might be a possibility?
* static comments baked into the site is an option with some fancy webhooks, but it already takes a couple minutes to do any sort of page deployment, and then there's the issue of spam

If anyone has other ideas, [post here](https://github.com/zmike/zmike.github.io/pull/1) about it.

## Main Topic
After this boring procedural opening, let's get to something exciting that nobody blogs about: shader linking.

**What is shader linking?** Shader linking is the process by which shaders are "linked" together to match up I/O blocks and optimize the runtime.
