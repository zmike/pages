## Blog Returns

Once again, I ended up not blogging for most of the week. When this happens, there's one of two possibilities: I'm either taking a break or I'm so deep into some code that I've forgotten about everything else in my life including sleep.

This time was the latter. I delved into the deepest parts of zink and discovered that the driver is, in fact, functioning only through a combination of sheer luck and a truly unbelievable amount of driver stalls that provide enough forced synchronization and slow things down enough that we don't explode into a flaming mess every other frame.

Oops.

I've fixed all of the crazy things I found, and, in the process, made some sizable performance gains that I'm planning to spend a while blogging about in considerable depth next week.

And when I say sizable, I'm talking in the range of 50-100% fps gains.

But it's Friday, and I'm sure nobody wants to just see *numbers* or *benchmarks*. Let's get into something that's interesting on a technical level.
