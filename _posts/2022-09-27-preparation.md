## Shoutouts

Big thanks to Timur for taking over merging all my misc RADV patches. I'm so far underwater I can see the bottom of the Mariana Trench, and without his help, these likely wouldn't be landing until 2023.

## Cooking Up A Storm

It's been a while, but today's blog is a zink blog. What's been happening?

Well, if you've been following prominent news sites, you might not think there's too much happening on the performance front. And whew do I have news for you.

Big news.

I'm throwing down the gauntlet.

Mesa 22.3 is going to be the **BIG PERF RELEASE**.

I said it.

Don't believe me? Bam, have another 20-30% performance on Turnip I "quietly" [merged](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/18358) a month ago. And also some amount of improvement on Intel that I haven't quantified yet. Who could've guessed that enabling compression on images would have benefits?!
