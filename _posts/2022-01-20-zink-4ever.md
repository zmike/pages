## It's Happening (For Real)

After weeks of hunting for the latest rumors of jekstrand's future job prospects, I've finally done it: **zink now supports more extensions than any other OpenGL driver in Mesa**.

That's right.

Check it on mesamatrix if you don't believe me.

A couple days ago I [merged](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/14498) support for the [external memory extensions](https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/bridging-the-opengl-and-vulkan-divide.html) that I'd been putting off, and today we got [sparse textures](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/14381) thanks to Qiang Yu at AMD doing 99% of the work to plumb the extensions through the rest of Mesa.

There's even [another sparse texture extension](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/14488), which I've already landed all the support for in zink, that should be enabled for the upcoming release.

## What's Next?

Zink (sometimes) has the performance, now it has the features, so naturally the focus now is going to shift to compatibility and correctness. Kopper is going to mostly take care of the former, which leaves the latter. There aren't a ton of CTS cases failing.

Ideally, by the end of the year, there won't be any.
