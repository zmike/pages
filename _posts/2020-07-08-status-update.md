## A quick break
I've been blogging pretty in-depth about Zink and related code for a while, so let's do a quick roundup with some future blog post spoilers there:
* [Yesterday's ANV MR](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/5792) merged
* [ARB_depth_clamp](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/5495) is also now merged
* [gl_FragColor fixup](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/5687) merged

**Done but awaiting dependencies before merge**
* [UBO support](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/2872) from last week's involved blog series
* [Primitive restart](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/2873) which I'll likely cover in a quick post tomorrow
* [GLSL 1.40](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/2874) was a variety of misc fixups
* [GL 3.1](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues?milestone_title=Zink+OpenGL+3.1+support) depends on the above items, so that's done
* [Geometry shaders](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/3175) are working about as well as they can after tackling that over the past day or so
* GLSL 1.50 is at 95% of piglit tests passing
* GL 3.2 doesn't even have a mile
