## 22.0

I always do one of these big roundups for each Mesa release, so here's what you can expect to see from zink in the upcoming release:
* fewer hangs on RADV
* massively improved usability on NVIDIA
* greatly improved performance with unsupported texture download formats (e.g., CS:GO, L4D2)
* more extensions: ARB_sparse_texture, ARB_sparse_texture2, ARB_sparse_texture_clamp, EXT_memory_object, EXT_memory_object_fd, GL_EXT_semaphore, GL_EXT_semaphore_fd
