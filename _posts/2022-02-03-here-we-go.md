## 22.0

I always do one of these big roundups for each Mesa release, so here's what you can expect to see from zink in the upcoming release:
* fewer hangs on RADV
* massively improved usability on NVIDIA
* greatly improved performance with unsupported texture download formats (e.g., CS:GO, L4D2)
* more extensions: ARB_sparse_texture, ARB_sparse_texture2, ARB_sparse_texture_clamp, EXT_memory_object, EXT_memory_object_fd, GL_EXT_semaphore, GL_EXT_semaphore_fd
* ~1000% improved glxgears performance (be sure to run with `--i-know-this-is-not-a-benchmark` to see the real speed)
* tons and tons and tons of bug fixes

All around looking like another great release.

## I Hate gl_PointSize And So Can You
Yes, we're here.

After literally years of awfulness, I've finally solved (for good) the debacle that is point size conversion from GL to Vulkan.

What's so awful about it, you might be asking. How hard can it be to just add `gl_PointSize` to a shader, you follow up with as you push your glasses higher up your nose.

Allow me to explain.

In Vulkan, there is exactly one method for setting the size of points: the `gl_PointSize` shader output controls it, and that's it.

In [OpenGL (core profile)](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/gl/glspec46.core.pdf):
* **14.4 Points** `If program point size mode is enabled, the derived point size is taken from the (potentially clipped) shader built-in gl_PointSize written by the last vertex processing stage and clamped to the implementation-dependent point size range. If the value written to gl_PointSize is less than or equal to zero, or if no value was written to gl_PointSize, results are undefined. If program point size mode is disabled, the derived point size is specified with the command void PointSize( float size );`
* **11.2.3.4 Tessellation Evaluation Shader Outputs** `Tessellation evaluation shaders have a number of built-in output variables used to pass values to equivalent built-in input variables read by subsequent shader stages or to subsequent fixed functionality vertex processing pipeline stages. These variables are gl_Position, gl_PointSize, gl_ClipDistance, and gl_CullDistance, and all behave identically to equivalently named vertex shader outputs.`
* **11.3.4.4 Geometry Shader Inputs** `Structure member gl_PointSize holds the per-vertex point size written by the upstream shader to the built-in output variable gl_PointSize. If the upstream shader does not write gl_PointSize, the value of gl_PointSize is undefined, regardless of the value of the enable PROGRAM_POINT_SIZE.`

In short, if `PROGRAM_POINT_SIZE` is enabled, then points are sized based on the `gl_PointSize` shader output of the last vertex stage, but only if the last stage is a vertex shader or tessellation evaluation, because if there's a geometry shader, you ignore `PROGRAM_POINT_SIZE` unconditionally.

In OpenGL ES (versions [2.0](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/es/2.0/es_full_spec_2.0.withchanges.pdf), [3.0](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/es/3.0/es_spec_3.0.withchanges.pdf), [3.1](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/es/3.1/es_spec_3.1.withchanges.pdf)):
* **(3.3 | 3.4 | 13.3) Points** `The point size is taken from the shader built-in gl_PointSize written by the
vertex shader, and clamped to the implementation-dependent point size range.`

In OpenGL ES (version [3.2](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/es/3.2/es_spec_3.2.withchanges.pdf)):
* **13.5 Points** `The point size is determined by the last vertex processing stage. If the last vertex processing stage. is not a vertex shader, the point size is 1.0. If the last vertex processing stage is a vertex shader, the point size is taken from the shader built-in gl_PointSize written by the vertex shader, and is clamped to the implementation-dependent point size range.`

Thus for an ES context, the point size always comes from the last vertex stage, which means it can be anything it wants to be if that stage is a vertex shader and **cannot be written to for all other cases** (but not really, for the bolded part of that statement, because everyone, even the CTS, ignores the part about point size being restricted to 1.0 and not explicitly written to).

What do the specs agree on?
* If a vertex shader is the last vertex stage, it can write `gl_PointSize`

Literally that's it.

Awesome.

## Zink
As we know, Vulkan has a very simple and clearly defined model for point size:
```
The point size is taken from the (potentially clipped) shader built-in PointSize written by:
• the geometry shader, if active;
• the tessellation evaluation shader, if active and no geometry shader is active;
• the vertex shader, otherwise
- 27.10. Points
```

It really can be that simple.

So one would think that we can just hook up some conditionals based on the GL rules and then export the correct value.

That would be easy.

Simple.

It would make sense.

## XFB
It gets worse.

`gl_PointSize` is a valid XFB varying, which means it must be exported correctly to the transform feedback buffer. For the ES, it's simple, but for desktop GL, there's a little something called `PROGRAM_POINT_SIZE` state which totally fucks that up. Because, as we know, Vulkan has exactly one way of setting point size, and it's the shader variable.
