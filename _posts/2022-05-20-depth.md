## Again

Two posts in one month is a record for May of 2022. Might even shoot for three at this rate.

Yesterday I posted a hasty roundup of what's been going on with zink.

It was not comprehensive.

What else have I been working on, you might ask.

## Introducing A New Zink-enabled Platform
We all know I'm champing at the bit to further my goal of world domination with zink on all platforms, so it was only a matter of time before I branched out from the big two-point-five of desktop GPU vendors (NVIDIA, AMD, and also maybe Intel sometimes).

Thus it was that a glorious bounty descended from on high at Valve: a shiny new A630 Coachz Chromebook that runs on the open source Qualcomm driver, Turnip.

How did the initial testing go?

My initial combined, all-the-tests-at-once CTS run (KHR46, 4.6 confidential, all dEQP) yielded over 1500 crashes and over 3000 failures.

Brutal.

I then accidentally bricked my kernel by foolishly allowing my distro to upgrade it for me, at which point I defenestrated the device.
