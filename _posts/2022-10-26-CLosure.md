## Another Year Passes

I meant to blog more, but it seems we're out of time. As we all know, SGC must go into hibernation at the end of the year to recharge. Workplace safety laws require sufficient rest time be given to meme-rich environments, and you can't spell SGC without safety.

No, you can't.
