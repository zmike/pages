## Another Year Passes

I meant to blog more, but it seems we're out of time. As we all know, SGC must go into hibernation at the end of the year to recharge. Workplace safety laws require sufficient rest time be given to meme-rich environments, and you can't spell SGC without safety.

No, you can't.

I've got two more blog posts that I'm hoping to release before the blog's hard-earned time off begins.

The first about OpenCL.

That's this one.

## Zink: Also a CL Driver
We all knew this would happen.

We follow Karol on [twitter](https://twitter.com/karolherbst).

We've seen the wild, unhinged tweets from [his local pub](https://britspub.com/) claiming to have LuxMark or some other insane, CL-based application running on top of who knows what driver.

And it was only a matter of time before he cornered me at XDC for a quick "talk". It was completely normal the way he had no fewer than four laptops physically harnessed to his person as he strutted around, looking for hapless driver maintainers upon which to foist his latest and least sane project. I wasn't at all afraid for my life when he told me that by the time he let me leave the conference hall that day, rusticl would be working on zink.

I'm here blogging about it now, so obviously everything is fine and I'm not still trapped in his basement, but let's take a look at some of the challenges I faced over that grueling, interminable period of CL bring-up besides lack of water and food.
