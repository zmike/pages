## Please File Responsibly

The other day I posted about new efforts to create a compendium of games that work with zink. Initial feedback has been good, and thanks to everyone who has contributed so far.

I realized too late that I needed to be more explicit about what feedback I wanted, however.

There are three tickets open, one for each type of problem:
* This ticket is for [games that work without any issues](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/8930)
* This ticket is for [games with bad perf](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/8223)
* This ticket is for [games with issues](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/8943)

Please don't dump the results of your entire steam library into a single ticket. Take the extra few seconds and split up your results appropriately.

## Results

With all that said, the quantity of games in the "working" list far outnumbers those in the "not working" lists, which is great. On the flip side, anyone looking for a starting point to contribute to zink now has quite a few real world cases to check out.
