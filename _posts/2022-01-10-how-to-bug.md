## This Is A Serious Blog

I posted some fun fluff pieces last week to kick off the new year, but now it's time to get down to brass tacks.

Everyone knows adding features is just flipping on the enable button. Now it's time to see some real work.

If you don't like real work, stop reading. Stop right now. Now.

Alright, now that all the haters are gone, let's put on our bisecting snorkels and dive in.

## Regressions Suck
The dream of 2022 was that I'd come back and everything would work exactly how I left it. All the same tests would pass, all the perf would be there, and my driver would compile.

I got two of those things, which isn't too bad.

After spending a while bisecting and debugging last week, I categorized a number of regressions to RADV problems which probably only affect me since there's no Vulkan CTS cases for them (yet). But today I came to the last of the problem cases: `dEQP-GLES31.functional.tessellation_geometry_interaction.feedback.tessellation_output_quads_geometry_output_points`.

There's nothing too remarkable about the test. It's XFB, so, according to Jason Ekstrand, future Head of Graphic Wows at Pixar, [it's terrible](http://www.jlekstrand.net/jason/blog/2018/10/transform-feedback-is-terrible-so-why/).
