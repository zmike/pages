# It Me, Maintenance5

After a long week of what-even-happened, it's finally time to talk about maintenance5.

This long-awaited maintenance extension has a number of great and zinkful features:
* `VK_FORMAT_A8_UNORM_KHR` for native A8 handling
  - totally works all the time and doesn't at all need any workarounds for cases where the driver only supports a certain subset of the required format features
* a property to detect Intel hardware
* default value of 1.0 for `gl_PointSize`
* deprecating shader modules
  - still gonna keep using them
* `VK_REMAINING_ARRAY_LAYERS`
* `Clarification that copies between images of any type are allowed, treating 1D images as 2D images with a height of 1.`
  - already been doing it since 2018

But who can guess which one is the topic of this blog post?

# Hell Yeah
Finally a default value for `gl_PointSize`.

Long-term fans of the blog will recall that I've previously raged against the insane concept that `pointsize must be written` many times prior. In fact, it remains [the]({{site.url}}/but-it-was-not-over) [second]({{site.url}}/the-saga-continues) [most]({{site.url}}/Slots) [blogged]({{site.url}}/debugging) [about]({{site.url}}/wew) [topic]({{site.url}}/here-we-go) in SGC history right behind ~~Big Triangle~~descriptor management, the topic that all modern graphics-related blogs must cover above all others.
