## Integration

A quick, off-hour post from me to share some exciting news in an unlikely area.

As of [this moment](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/17992), Mesa is now using the [Mold linker](https://github.com/rui314/mold) in CI for faster build times.

If you haven't tried Mold yet, you're just pointlessly wasting your own time.

Thanks to everyone who works on Mold and everyone who helped get this change merged.
