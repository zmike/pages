## A Quintessential Metric

There's been a lot of talk about driver overhead in the Mesa community as of late, in large part begun by Marek Olšák and his daredevil stunts driving RadeonSI through flaming hoops while juggling chainsaws.

While zink isn't quite at that level yet (and neither am I), there's still some progress being made that I'd like to dig into a bit.

## What Is Overhead?
As in all software, overhead is the performance penalty that is incurred as compared to a baseline measurement. In Mesa, a lot of people know of driver overhead as "Gallium sucks" and/or "A Gallium-based driver is slow" due to the fact that Gallium does incur some amount of overhead as compared to the old-style immediate mode DRI drivers.

While it's true that there is an amount of performance lost by using Gallium in this sense, it's also true that the performance _gained_ is much greater. The reason for this is that Gallium is able to batch commands and state changes for every driver using it, allowing redundant calls to avoid triggering any work in the GPU.

It also makes for an easier time profiling and improving upon
