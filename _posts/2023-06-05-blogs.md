## It's that time again

Yes, we've just skipped over the third anniversary of SGC and the blog. Time flies when you're making triangles. I had some plans, and I was gonna make some posts, and then I didn't, so here we are. Great.

There's been a lot of things in motion over the past however long it's been since I blogged. Exciting things. Big things. Not like Half Life 3 big, but you know. Big.

Blogging's not like riding a bike. You gotta ease back into it after you take some time off.
