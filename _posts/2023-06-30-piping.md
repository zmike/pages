## Features

I mentioned some time back about Konstantin's heroic efforts to add all the descriptor features to Lavapipe.

After a lot of battling CI those efforts have finally paid off, and Lavapipe now [supports all the features](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/22828). Enough to run a credible amount of vkd3d-proton, in fact.

Great work. Can't wait to see how he tackles sparse binding.
