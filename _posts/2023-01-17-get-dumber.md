## Have You Ever...

Had one of those moments when you looked at some code, looked at the output of your program, and then exclaimed COMPUTER, WHY YOU SO DUMB?

Of course not.

Nobody uses the spoken word in the current year.

But you've definitely complained about how dumb your computer is on IRC/discord/etc.

And I'm here today to complain in a blog post.

My computer (compiler) is really fucking dumb.

## HOW DUMB IS IT?

I know you're wondering how dumb a computer (compiler) would have to be to prompt an outraged blog post from me, the paragon of temperance.
