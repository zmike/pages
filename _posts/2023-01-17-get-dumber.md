## Have You Ever...

Had one of those moments when you looked at some code, looked at the output of your program, and then exclaimed COMPUTER, WHY YOU SO DUMB?

Of course not.

Nobody uses the spoken word in the current year.

But you've definitely complained about how dumb your computer is on IRC/discord/etc.

And I'm here today to complain in a blog post.

My computer (compiler) is really fucking dumb.

## HOW DUMB IS IT?

I know you're wondering how dumb a computer (compiler) would have to be to prompt an outraged blog post from me, the paragon of temperance.

Well.

Let's take a look!

> Disclaimer: I have no idea what's happening here, and you are now reading at your own peril.

Some time ago, avid blog followers will recall that I created [vkoverhead](https://github.com/zmike/vkoverhead/) for evaluating CPU overhead in Vulkan drivers. Intel and NVIDIA have both contributed since its inception, which has no relevance but I'm sneaking it in as today's fun fact because nobody will read the middle of this paragraph. Using vkoverhead, I've found something very strange on RADV. Something bizarre. Something terrifying.

**debugoptimized builds of Mesa are (significantly) faster than release builds for some cases**.

Here's an example.

debugoptimized:
```
$ ./vkoverhead -test 76  -duration 5
vkoverhead running on AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT (RADV NAVI10):
	* descriptor numbers are reported as thousands of operations per second
	* percentages for descriptor cases are relative to 'descriptor_noop'
  76, descriptor_1image,                                  157308,       100.0%
```

release:
```
$ ./vkoverhead -test 76  -duration 5
vkoverhead running on AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT (RADV NAVI10):
	* descriptor numbers are reported as thousands of operations per second
	* percentages for descriptor cases are relative to 'descriptor_noop'
  76, descriptor_1image,                                  135309,       100.0%
```

This is where we are now.

## How?

That's a good question, and for the answer I'm going to turn it over to the blog's compiler expert, [Mr. Azathoth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azathoth):

Thanks, champ.

As we can see, I'm about to meddle with dark forces beyond the limits of human comprehension, so anyone who values their sanity should escape while they still can.

Let's take a look at a debugoptimized flamegraph to check out what sort of cosmic horror we're delving into.

[![stupid-perf.png]({{site.url}}/assets/stupid-perf.png)]({{site.url}}/assets/stupid-perf.png)

Obviously this is a descriptor updating case, and upon opening up the code for the final function, this is what our eyes will refuse to see:

```c
static ALWAYS_INLINE void
write_image_descriptor(unsigned *dst, unsigned size, VkDescriptorType descriptor_type, const VkDescriptorImageInfo *image_info)
{
   struct radv_image_view *iview = NULL;
   union radv_descriptor *descriptor;

   if (image_info)
      iview = radv_image_view_from_handle(image_info->imageView);

   if (!iview) {
      memset(dst, 0, size);
      return;
   }

   if (descriptor_type == VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_IMAGE) {
      descriptor = &iview->storage_descriptor;
   } else {
      descriptor = &iview->descriptor;
   }
   assert(size > 0);

   memcpy(dst, descriptor, size);
}
```

It seems simple enough. Nothing too terrible here.

## This Is Where It Gets Stupid
In the execution of this test case, the iterated callstack will look something like:

```
radv_UpdateDescriptorSets ->
radv_update_descriptor_sets_impl (inlined) ->
write_image_descriptor_impl (inlined) ->
write_image_descriptor (inlined)
```

That's a lot of inlining.

Typically inlining isn't a problem when used properly. It makes things faster (citation needed) in some cases (citation needed). Note the caveats.

One thing of note in the above code snippet is that `memcpy` is called with a variable `size` parameter. This isn't ideal since it prevents the compiler from making certain assumptions aboutâ€”What's that, Mr. Azathoth? It's not variable, you say? It's always writing 32 bytes, you say?

```c
case VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_IMAGE:
   write_image_descriptor_impl(device, cmd_buffer, 32, ptr, buffer_list,
                               writeset->descriptorType, writeset->pImageInfo + j);
```

Wow, thanks, Mr. Azathoth, I totally would've missed that!

And *surely* the compiler (GCC 12.2.1) wouldn't fuck this up, right?
