## Extensions Extensions Extensions

Once more, I've spun the wheel of topics to blog about and landed on something extension-related. Such is the life of those working with Vulkan.

In this case, the extension is [VK_EXT_custom_border_color](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_custom_border_color.html), the underlying implementation for which I had the luxury of testing on ANV as written by the memelord himself, Ivan Briano.

Let's get to it.

The setup for this (in `zink_screen.c`) is the same as for every extension, and I've blogged about this previously, so there's no new ground to cover here.

## Border Coloring
Fortunately, this is one of the simpler extensions to implement as well. This code is completely exclusive to the `struct pipe_context::create_sampler_state` hook, which is what gallium uses to have drivers setup their samplers (not sampler**views**, as that's separate).

Here's the current implementation:
```c
static void *
zink_create_sampler_state(struct pipe_context *pctx,
                          const struct pipe_sampler_state *state)
{
   struct zink_screen *screen = zink_screen(pctx->screen);

   VkSamplerCreateInfo sci = {};
   sci.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_SAMPLER_CREATE_INFO;
   sci.magFilter = zink_filter(state->mag_img_filter);
   sci.minFilter = zink_filter(state->min_img_filter);

   if (state->min_mip_filter != PIPE_TEX_MIPFILTER_NONE) {
      sci.mipmapMode = sampler_mipmap_mode(state->min_mip_filter);
      sci.minLod = state->min_lod;
      sci.maxLod = state->max_lod;
   } else {
      sci.mipmapMode = VK_SAMPLER_MIPMAP_MODE_NEAREST;
      sci.minLod = 0;
      sci.maxLod = 0;
   }

   sci.addressModeU = sampler_address_mode(state->wrap_s);
   sci.addressModeV = sampler_address_mode(state->wrap_t);
   sci.addressModeW = sampler_address_mode(state->wrap_r);
   sci.mipLodBias = state->lod_bias;

   if (state->compare_mode == PIPE_TEX_COMPARE_NONE)
      sci.compareOp = VK_COMPARE_OP_NEVER;
   else {
      sci.compareOp = compare_op(state->compare_func);
      sci.compareEnable = VK_TRUE;
   }

   sci.borderColor = VK_BORDER_COLOR_FLOAT_TRANSPARENT_BLACK; // TODO
   sci.unnormalizedCoordinates = !state->normalized_coords;

   if (state->max_anisotropy > 1) {
      sci.maxAnisotropy = state->max_anisotropy;
      sci.anisotropyEnable = VK_TRUE;
   }

   struct zink_sampler_state *sampler = CALLOC(1, sizeof(struct zink_sampler_state));
   if (!sampler)
      return NULL;

   if (vkCreateSampler(screen->dev, &sci, NULL, &sampler->sampler) != VK_SUCCESS) {
      FREE(sampler);
      return NULL;
   }

   return sampler;
}
```
It's just populating a [VkSamplerCreateInfo](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkSamplerCreateInfo.html) struct from `struct pipe_sampler_state`. Nothing too unusual.

Looking at the `VK_EXT_custom_border_color` spec, the only change required for a sampler to handle a custom border color is to add a populated [VkSamplerCustomBorderColorCreateInfoEXT](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkSamplerCustomBorderColorCreateInfoEXT.html) struct into the `pNext` chain for the `VkSamplerCreateInfo`.

The struct populating is simple enough:
```c
VkSamplerCustomBorderColorCreateInfoEXT cbci = {};
cbci.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_SAMPLER_CUSTOM_BORDER_COLOR_CREATE_INFO_EXT;
assert(screen->border_color_feats.customBorderColorWithoutFormat);
cbci.format = VK_FORMAT_UNDEFINED;
/* these are identical unions */
memcpy(&cbci.customBorderColor, &state->border_color, sizeof(union pipe_color_union));
sci.pNext = &cbci;
sci.borderColor = VK_BORDER_COLOR_INT_CUSTOM_EXT;
```
Helpfully here, the layouts of `union pipe_color_union` and the `customBorderColor` member of the Vulkan struct are the same, so this can just be copied directly. I added an assert to handle the case where the `customBorderColorWithoutFormat` feature isn't provided by the driver, since currently I'm just being a bit lazy and ANV handles it just fine, but this shouldn't be too much work to fix up if zink is ever run on a driver that doesn't support it.

With this set, border colors will be drawn as expected.

## Conditional
It's not always the case that border coloring is necessary, however, and there's also limits that must be obeyed.

For the former, the wrap values (`enum pipe_tex_wrap`) can be checked from the sampler state to determine whether specified border colors are going to be used, allowing them to be omitted when they're unnecessary.
