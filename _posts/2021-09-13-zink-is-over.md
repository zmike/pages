## Zink Is Over: This Time I'm Serious.

Look.

I know what you're gonna say, and maybe I did just say zink was done a week or two ago.

I'm not saying I didn't.

But that was practically last year at the speed that zink's codebase moves and its unrivaled developer community sits in my office eating cookies between Mesa builds, and it was also before I set off on my journey to make the rest of [those zany Phoronix benchmark games](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=zink-sub-alloc) run instead of crashing or whatever.

What do we got left on that list anyway?

## Metro: Last Light Redux

Oh you want some Metro? We got Metro at home.

## HITMAN

Agent 47, I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that. Pull yourself together.

## Basemark: High Settings

It's uh... Mangohud's slowing me down.

## Bioshock Infinite

I bet you're wondering where this one is, huh.

## Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War

Easy as that, juâ€”Wait, **what**?

This game *requires* bindless textures just to run? Is this a joke? Even fucking DOOM 2016, the final boss of OpenGL, doesn't *require* bindless textures.

Fine.

Totally fine.

Not at all a problem, and I'm sure it'll be easy to do.

Definitely no reason why [only two Mesa drivers total implement it](https://mesamatrix.net/#ExtensionsthatarenotpartofanyOpenGLorOpenGLESversion_Extensions_Extension_GL_ARB_bindless_texture) other than it being some trivial switch that everyone forgot to flip, right?

Probably just a config value here, or maybe a couple lines of code there...

Ignore all the validation errors because descriptor indexing isn't accurately supported...

Add some null checks...

Fire up ASAN to fix a [random stack explosion](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/12829)...

File a [piglit ticket](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/piglit/-/issues/57) because two of the eighty unit tests for the extension are bugged and these are quite literally the only unit tests available...

Kapow, first try, expect it in zink-wip later today-ish.

It's just that easy.

If you disagree, you are nitpicking and biased.
