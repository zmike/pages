## Another Quarter Down

As everyone who's anyone knows, the next Mesa release branchpoint is coming up tomorrow. Like usual, here's the rundown on what to expect from zink in this release:
* *zero* performance improvements (that I'm aware of)
* Kopper has landed: Vulkan WSI is now used and NVIDIA drivers can finally run at full speed
* *lots* of bugs fixed
* seriously so many bugs
* I'm not even joking
* literally this whole quarter was just fixing bugs
