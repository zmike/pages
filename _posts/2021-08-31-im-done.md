## Zink Is Over

A while ago I blogged about [finishing up ES 3.2]({{site.url}}/at-last/). Then I didn't mention it again because...well, I suppose I've only blogged four times since then, but I'm going to pretend this was part of my master plan to make everyone forget so I could build hype again.

The hype is here: Zink can now* [run ES 3.2 apps](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/12603).
* "now" is a variable unit of time subject to CI not trying to drown itself at the nearest pub the instant daniels takes his eyes off it

## What Does This Mean For The Future?
I know I've said this a few times previously, but this time I mean it. Zink is done. The final boss has been beaten, there's no more versions to support, no [extensions](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/ARB/ARB_bindless_texture.txt) left on my todo list, definitely [no](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=âœ“&state=opened&label_name[]=zink) [bugs](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/zmike/mesa/-/issues) remaining, and performance can't possibly improve further.

If you think you've found a zink bug, report it to whoever wrote the test or app you're running, because the only thing I plan on doing for the rest of 2021 is playing Cyberpunk 2077 on Lavapipe. Right after it finishes loading.
