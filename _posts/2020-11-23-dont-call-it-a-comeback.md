## I've Been Here For...

I guess I never left, really, since I've been vicariously living the life of someone who still writes zink patches through reviewing and discussing some great community efforts that are ongoing.

But now I'm back living that life of someone who writes zink patches.

[Valve](http://www.valvesoftware.com/) has generously agreed to sponsor my work on graphics-related projects.

For the time being, that work happens to be zink.

## Ambition
I don't want to just make a big post about leaving and then come back after a couple weeks like nothing happened.

It's 2020.

We need some sort of positive energy and excitement here.

As such, I'm hereby announcing **Operation Oxidize**, an ambitious endeavor between me and the formidably skillful Erik Faye-Lund of [Collabora](https://www.collabora.com/).

**We're going to land 99% of zink-wip into mainline Mesa by the end of the year, bringing the driver up to basic GL 4.6 and ES 3.2 support with vastly improved performance.**

Or at least, that's the goal.

Will we succeed?

Stay tuned to find out!
