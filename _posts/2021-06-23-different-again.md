## BREAKING: THIS IS NO LONGER A ZINK BLOG

For today, at least.

Today, this blog is a Gallium blog. And it's a momentous day indeed.

We all know what this is:

[![portal2-title.png]({{site.url}}/assets/portal2-title.png)]({{site.url}}/assets/portal2-title.png)

It's a screenshot of Portal 2 with the Gallium HUD activated and VSync disabled.

But what driver is that underneath?

Well, for today's blog it's RadeonSI, the reference implementation of a Gallium driver.

And **Why is this?**, I can hear you all asking.

What if I told you that this screenshot with 10% higher FPS is also Portal 2 with VSync disabled on RadeonSI:
