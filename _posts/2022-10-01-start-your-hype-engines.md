## It's Happening.

After 7 years in hibernation since LinuxCon Japan, I will once again be making a limited return to the conference trail next week.

To where, you ask?

XDC 2022.

Where I will be delivering a [presentation](https://indico.freedesktop.org/event/2/contributions/64/) that finally, at long last, unleashes the true potential of Zink as a driver.

Be there. Watch online. Tweet about it.
