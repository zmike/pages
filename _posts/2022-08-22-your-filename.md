I was planning to write this Friday, but then it was Friday so I didn't.

You know how it is.

I've been doing a lot of work on CPU optimizations in zink lately. I had planned to do some benchmarks of this, but now it's Monday and [someone has already done it for me](https://www.phoronix.com/review/zink-radeon-august2022), so I won't.

Sometimes it's like that too.

But the overly-technical, word-heavy blog post still needs to be written, and now it's Monday, so here I am.
