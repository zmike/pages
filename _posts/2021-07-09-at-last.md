## It Happened.

That's right.

Zink(-wip) now fully supports [GL_KHR_blend_equation_advanced](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/KHR/KHR_blend_equation_advanced.txt), which means **ES 3.2 is a go** (once my local CI clears me to push today's snapshot).

And all it took was one brief exchange with a top Mesa reviewer who is incidentally rumored to be undergoing training deep in the mountains to become an expert BBQ master on the extremely professional #zink channel on OFTC:

 > <jekstrand That's the thing.  You can totally do it in Zink.

My mind was blown.

Why hadn't I thought of that sooner?
 
I could justâ€¦do it? Just like that? And then it'd be done?

Truly the experts are on a different level from us mortals.
 
So now it's done, and that means zink is finished. I don't expect there will be any more work to do now that the final boss has been defeated, so don't even bother trying to file bug reports.
