## The Unsung Heroes

This is going to be less of a technical post and more of a *have you thought about* post. With that said, I think this is more important than the average post here, meaning that expectations should be set somewhere between *I need to stop everything else I'm doing until I finish reading* and *this is the most important event in my life*.

Let's talk about open source. No, Open Source. The idea of it.

## How Does Open Source Work?
Those of you who are veterans are rolling your eyes. Another post about the glory of Open Source.

The thing about Open Source is that it's sort of whatever you make of it. At its core, it's about getting people together to solve a problemâ€”community building. Whether that community is large or small, the goal is the same: write some quality software.

To that end, you've got your usual corporate powerpoint slide of community roles:
* maintainers
* developers
* reviewers
* whatever other buzzwords are currently relevant

In Mesa, the *maintainer* and *developer* roles are mostly synonymous among core contributors: these are the people who write the code that gets posted about on all the news sites.

The *reviewer* is a bit more mysterious though. Who are reviewers, and what separates them from the others?
