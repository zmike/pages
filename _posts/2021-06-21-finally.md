## We Did It

After months and months of the construction crews hammering away, [VK_EXT_multi_draw](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_multi_draw.html) has now been released for general use.

Will this suddenly make zink the fastest GPU driver in history?

Obviously.

Long-time readers will recall that I [memed about this extension]({{site.url}}/assets/layin-that-pipe/) some time ago, and the numbers in a synthetic benchmark targeted at exactly this feature are phenomenal.

For more on the topic, we go to our Senior Multidraw Correspondent and my personal Khronos BFF, [Ricardo Garcia](https://rg3.name/202106210630.html), who has been following this story since the beginning.
