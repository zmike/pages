## Innocuous

Who else out there knows the feeling of opening up a bug ticket, thinking *Oh, I fixed that*, and then closing the tab?

Don't lie, I know you do it too.

Such was the case when I (repeatedly) opened [this ticket](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/6618) about a rendering regression in [Dirty Rally](https://store.steampowered.com/app/310560/DiRT_Rally/).

To me, this is a normal, accurate photo of a car driving along a dirt track in the woods. A very bright track, sure, but it's plainly visible, just like the spectators lining the sides of the track.

The reporter insisted there was a bug in action, however, so I strapped on my snorkel and oven mitt and got to work.

For the first time.

Last week.

## Bug #1

We all remember our first bug. It's usually "the code didn't compile the first time I tried". The worst bug there is.

The first bug I found in pursuit of this so-called rendering anomaly was not a simple compile error. No, unfortunately the code built and ran fine thanks to Mesa's incredible and rock-stable CI systems (this was last week), which meant I had to continue on this futile quest to find out whatever was wrong.

Next, I looked at the ticket again and downloaded the trace, which was unfortunately provided to prevent me from claiming that I didn't have the game or couldn't find it or couldn't launch it or was too lazy. Another unlucky roll of the dice in the same ticket.

After sitting through thirty minutes of loading and shader compiling in the trace, I was treated to another picturesque view of a realistic racing environment:

B-e-a-u-tiful.

If this is a bug, I don't want to know what it's supposed to look like.

Nevertheless, I struggled gamely onward. The first tool in any driver developers kit is naturally [RenderDoc](https://renderdoc.org/), which I definitely know how to use and am an expert in wielding for all manner of purposes, the least of which is fixing trivial "bugs" like this one. So I fired up RenderDoc—again, without even the slightest of troubles since I use it all the time and it works great for doing all the things I want it to do—got my capture of frame, and then loaded it up in QRenderDoc.

And, of course, QRenderDoc crashed because that was what I wanted it to do. It's what I always want it to do, really.

But, regrettably, the legendary Baldur Karlsson is on my team and can [fix bugs faster than I can report them](https://github.com/baldurk/renderdoc/commit/dc7d79a50a09026f121fc8590f46e2416bb2a7ad), so I was unable to continue claiming I couldn't proceed due to this minor inconvenience for long. I did my usual work in RenderDoc, which I won't even describe because it took such a short amount of time due to my staggering expertise in the area and definitely didn't result in finding [any more RenderDoc bugs](https://github.com/baldurk/renderdoc/commit/7142bf16e0fad6501b9632e7d7abcbdf027a8e86), and the result was clear to me: there were no bugs.

I did, however, notice that descriptor caching was performing suboptimally such that only the first descriptor used for UBOs/SSBOs was used to identify the cache entry, so I [fixed that](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/16927) in less time than it took to describe this entire non-bug nothingburger.

# Bug #2

I want you to look at the original image above, then look at this one here:

[![dirt-fail2.png]({{site.url}}/assets/dirt-fail2.png)]({{site.url}}/assets/dirt-fail2.png)

To me, these are indistinguishable. If you disagree, you are nitpicking and biased.
