## Innocuous

Who else out there knows the feeling of opening up a bug ticket, thinking *Oh, I fixed that*, and then closing the tab?

Don't lie, I know you do it too.

Such was the case when I (repeatedly) opened [this ticket](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/6618) about a rendering regression in [Dirty Rally](https://store.steampowered.com/app/310560/DiRT_Rally/).
