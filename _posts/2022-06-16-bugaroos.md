## Innocuous

Who else out there knows the feeling of opening up a bug ticket, thinking *Oh, I fixed that*, and then closing the tab?

Don't lie, I know you do it too.

Such was the case when I (repeatedly) opened [this ticket](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/6618) about a rendering regression in [Dirty Rally](https://store.steampowered.com/app/310560/DiRT_Rally/).

To me, this is a normal, accurate photo of a car driving along a dirt track in the woods. A very bright track, sure, but it's plainly visible, just like the spectators lining the sides of the track.

The reporter insisted there was a bug in action, however, so I strapped on my snorkel and oven mitt and got to work.

For the first time.

Last week.

## Bug #1

We all remember our first bug. It's usually "the code didn't compile the first time I tried". The worst bug there is.

The first bug I found in pursuit of this so-called rendering anomaly was not a simple compile error. No, unfortunately the code built and ran fine thanks to Mesa's incredible and rock-stable CI systems (this was last week), which meant I had to continue on this futile quest to find out whatever was wrong.
