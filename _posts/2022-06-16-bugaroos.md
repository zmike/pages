## Innocuous

Who else out there knows the feeling of opening up a bug ticket, thinking *Oh, I fixed that*, and then closing the tab?

Don't lie, I know you do it too.

Such was the case when I (repeatedly) opened [this ticket](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/6618) about a rendering regression in [Dirty Rally](https://store.steampowered.com/app/310560/DiRT_Rally/).

To me, this is a normal, accurate photo of a car driving along a dirt track in the woods. A very bright track, sure, but it's plainly visible, just like the spectators lining the sides of the track.

The reporter insisted there was a bug in action, however, so I strapped on my snorkel and oven mitt and got to work.

For the first time.

Last week.

## Bug #1

We all remember our first bug. It's usually "the code didn't compile the first time I tried". The worst bug there is.

The first bug I found in pursuit of this so-called rendering anomaly was not a simple compile error. No, unfortunately the code built and ran fine thanks to Mesa's incredible and rock-stable CI systems (this was last week), which meant I had to continue on this futile quest to find out whatever was wrong.

Next, I looked at the ticket again and downloaded the trace, which was unfortunately provided to prevent me from claiming that I didn't have the game or couldn't find it or couldn't launch it or was too lazy. Another unlucky roll of the dice in the same ticket.

After sitting through thirty minutes of loading and shader compiling in the trace, I was treated to another picturesque view of a realistic racing environment:

B-e-a-u-tiful.

If this is a bug, I don't want to know what it's supposed to look like.

Nevertheless, I struggled gamely onward. The first tool in any driver developers kit is naturally [RenderDoc](https://renderdoc.org/), which I definitely know how to use and am an expert in wielding for all manner of purposes, the least of which is fixing trivial "bugs" like this one.
