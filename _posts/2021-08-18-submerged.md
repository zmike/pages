## We Back

Just a quick update today while I dip my toes back into the blogosphere to remind myself that it's not so scary.

Remember when [I blogged about how nice it would be to have a suballocator](({{site.url}}/suballocate-me/)) all those months ago?

Now it's landed, and it's nice indeed to have a suballocator.

Remember when everyone wanted GL 4.6 compatibility contexts so they could play Feral ports of their favorite games? zink-wip did that [6 months ago](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/commit/?id=c1d342e986414a6e4227773a531bb1a0cca30f00).

What this all means is that it's more or less open testing season on zink. I've already got a [sizable](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/zmike/mesa/-/issues) number of tickets open for various Steam games based on zink-wip testing, but this is hardly conclusive.

What games work for you?

What games don't work?

If you don't tell me, I'm not gonna test them all myself.
