## Another Brief Review

This was a (relatively) quiet week in zink-world:
* [Custom border color](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/7487) support landed 
* Erik wrote and I reviewed [a patch](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/7606) that enabled some blitting optimizations but also [regressed a number of test cases](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/3843)
  * Oops
* I wrote and Erik reviewed [a series](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/7195) which improved some of the query code but also [regressed a number of test cases](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/3846)
  * Oops++
* The flurry of activity around [Quake3 not working on RADV](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/3776) died down as it's now been suggested that this is not a RADV bug and is instead the result of no developers fully understanding the majesty of RADV's pipeline barrier implementation
  * Developers around the world stunned by the possibility that they don't know everything
* Witold Baryluk has helpfully contributed a [truckload](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/zmike/mesa/-/issues) of issue tickets for my `zink-wip` branch after extensive testing on AMD hardware
  * I'll get to these at some point, I promise

Stay tuned for further updates.
