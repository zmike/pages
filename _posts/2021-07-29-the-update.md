## This is a title

I'm back.

Where did I go?

My birthday passed recently, so I gifted myself a couple weeks off from blogging. Feels good.

For today, this is a lavapipe blog.

## What's New With Lavapipe?
Lots.

Let's check out what's happened just in July:
* EXT_line_rasterization
* EXT_vertex_input_dynamic_state
* EXT_extended_dynamic_state2
* EXT_color_write_enable
* features.strictLines
* features.shaderStorageImageExtendedFormats
* features.shaderStorageImageReadWithoutFormat
* features.samplerAnisotropy
* KHR_timeline_semaphores

Also under the hood now is a [new 2D rasterizer from VMWare](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/11969) which yields "a 2x to 3x performance improvement for 2D workloads".
