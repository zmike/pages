# More Milestones

As everyone knows, Red Hat's top RustiCL expert, Karol "But it's only 10 o'clock?" Herbst, has been hard at work beating Mesa/Zink/RustiCL into shape. That effort continues to [bear fruit](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/25837), and with the merge of an upcoming MR it should be possible to pass OpenCL conformance with zink on multiple platforms.

This will make zink **THE FIRST EVER CONFORMANT VULKAN-BASED OPENCL IMPLEMENTATION**.

Great work all around. For up-to-the-second progress reports on this ecosystem-critical topic, don't forget to follow Karol on [social media](https://chaos.social/@karolherbst).
