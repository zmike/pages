## I Meant To Write This Some Time Ago But Then I Didn't

The blog has been there before, it'll be there again, I'm over it.

Let's talk about the only thing anyone cares about on this blog for the 23.1 release cycle: **perf**.

What does it mean? Who knows.

How does one acquire it? See above.

But everyone wants it, so I've gotta deliver like a hypothetical shipping company that delivers on-time and actually rings the bell when they drop something off instead of just hucking a box onto my front porch and running away to leave my stuff sitting out to get snowed on.

Unlike such a hypothetical shipping company which doesn't exist, perf does exist, and I've got it. Lots of it.

Let's talk about what parts of my soul I had to sell to get to this point in my life.

## Time-bending
Fans of the blog will recall I [previously wrote a post]({{site.url}}/new-news) that had great SEO for problem spaces and temporal ordering of events. This functionality, rewriting GL commands on-the-fly, has since been dubbed "time-bending" by prominent community members, so I guess that's what we're calling it since naming is the most important part of any technical challenge.

Initially, I implemented *time-bending* to be able to reorder some barriers and transfer operations and avoid splitting renderpasses, something that only the savages living in tiling GPU land care about. Is it useful on immediate-mode rendering GPUs, the ones we use in our daily lives for real work (NOT GAMING DON'T ASK ABOUT GAMING)?

Maybe? Outlook uncertain. Try again later.

So I'm implementing these great features with great names that are totally getting used by real people, and then notable CI and Perfetto enthusiast Emma Anholt
