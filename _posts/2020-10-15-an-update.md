## Busy, Busy, Busy

It's been a busy week for me in personal stuff, so my blogging has been a bit slow. Here's a brief summary of a few vaguely interesting things that I've been up to:
* I'm now up to **37fps** in the Heaven benchmark, which is an absolute unit of a number that brings me up to 68.5% of native GL
* I discovered that people have been reporting bugs for zink-wip (great) without tagging me (not great), and I'm not getting notifications for it (also not great). gitlab is hard.
* I added support for null UBOs in descriptor sets, which I think I was supposed to actually have done some time ago, but I hadn't run into any tests that hit it. null checks all the way down
* I fired up [supertuxkart](https://supertuxkart.net/Main_Page) for one of the reports, which led me down a rabbithole of discovering that part of my compute shader implementation was broken for big shared data loads; I was, for whatever reason, attempting to do an `OpAccessChain` with a result type of `uvec4` from a base type of `array<uint>`, which...it's just not going to work ever, so that's some strong work by past me
* I played supertuxkart for a good 30 seconds and took a screenshot

There's a weird flickering bug with the UI that I get in some levels that bears some looking into, but otherwise I get a steady `60/64/64` in zink vs `74/110/110` in IRIS (no idea what the 3 numbers mean, if anyone does, feel free to drop me a line).

That's it for today. Hopefully a longer post tomorrow but no promises.
