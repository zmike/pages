My name is Mike Blumenkrantz, and I do code super good. Eventually. I heard that people will think I write better code if I blog about it, so I'm here to do the equivalent of posting my gym mirror flexing on Insta.

### More Information

After completing a degree in Philosophy, I fell into a deep hole of Open Source contributions and have been trying to escape ever since. I've done work on EFL/Enlightenment, the Servo browser, Wayland protocol specifications, ccache, and Mesa drivers among other things.

Also I tried Javascript once but never finished the project I was working on.
